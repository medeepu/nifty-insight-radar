Broker API integration endpoints (stubs).

This router exposes endpoints expected by the client for placing
orders and retrieving positions via broker APIs such as Zerodha or
Dhan.  Currently these functions return placeholder responses.  You
should replace the stub logic with actual SDK calls and handle
authentication, order placement and portfolio queries securely.
