"""
Broker integrations package.

This package contains thin wrappers around third‑party broker APIs such as
Zerodha Kite Connect and Dhan.  In this environment the implementations are
stubs – they outline the methods required but do not perform any real API
calls.  You should replace the bodies of these methods with calls to your
broker's SDK or REST endpoints.
